This is an assignment to create a BigInteger class in C++. The project focuses on making the class usable in the same way built-in numeric datatypes can be used. The class takes a string representing an integer that is too large for the C++ int, and has the following overloaded operators to allow it to work like other numeric datatypes:

`+`       (Allows for two BigIntegers to be added together) <br>
`+`       (Allows a BigInteger and an int to be added together)<br>
`+=`      (Adds two BigIntegers together)<br>
`++`      (Overloaded post-increment for the BigInteger)<br>
`*`       (Multiplies two BigIntegers)<br>
`*=`      (Multiplies two BigIntegers)<br>
`<=`      (Relational operator to compare BigIntegers)<br>
`==`      (Relational operator to compare BigIntegers)<br>
`<<`      (Overloaded streaming operator that displays a BigInteger)<br>
overloaded 'double' conversion operator that converts the BigInteger into a double
